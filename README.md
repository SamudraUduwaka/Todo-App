# To-do App

My first approach for a Flutter project.

## Getting Started

According to my point, this project is a starting approach for a Flutter application.

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project as well  :)

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook)

For help getting started with Flutter development, view the
[online documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.
